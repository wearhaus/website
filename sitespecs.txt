*Navbar*

Navbar contained in own files, relies on js in custom.js to add opaque class depending on top pixel or not


*Rectangle angles*

Done using clipping masks on CSS, just copy the style to get the angles, modify degrees to see fit


*Title image*

image - contained in base.css as background image, to replace image find title/title-content background image in base.css

styling - DO NOT CHANGE STYLING or everything will die


*Mailing list*

Taken off of mailchimp and modified, do not change angles or shit will hit the fan


*Main info*

g_block - the transparent black background

images - images can be changed in base.css, look for the specific classes (touch, social, light) and the background images


*Video*

url - can just replace URL its whatever, keep extra attributes and DO NOT change the styling!


*Color Picker*

pls dont touch this. Objects drawn with canvas and colorpicker handled with javascript


*Fluff Continer (side gurl)*

image - change image in base.css (background-img)


*Specs*

images - located in html, can replace with whatever, CSS should handle size adjustment


*Blog*

grid - css is tricky here

blog_img is the most predominant class here, it gives the grid layout in terms of size. So just calculate however many squares you want, deduct (100 - (# squares * 2))/4 and that's the percent you want as blog_img width!

custom js handles hover over effects, which take the datacaption from blog-pre and handles a visible or hidden attribute on our caption overlay.
